The library automation I developed is written in C# and integrated with an SQL database. On the main page of the automation system, there are buttons for functions such as Member Registration, Member Listing, Lending Books, Lending List, Returning Books, Adding Books, Book Listing, Sorting, and Graphs. In the Member Listing section, you can search by member number and perform member deletion. The Lending List page allows filtering of lent books. Additionally, the Sorting page lets you view how many books each member has read and identify the members who have read the most and the fewest books. Members and books are seamlessly saved to the database and can be retrieved successfully when needed.
